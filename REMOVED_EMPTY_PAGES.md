# 🗑️ Removed Empty Pages from Navigation

## ✅ What I Did:

**Removed from Navigation:**
- ❌ **Gallery** - No data imported (can be added manually later)
- ❌ **Stories** - No data imported (can be added manually later)  
- ❌ **Music** - No data imported (can be added manually later)

**Kept in Navigation:**
- ✅ **Culture** - Page exists, can be filled manually in Sanity Studio
- ✅ All other pages with content (Home, About, Tours, Guides, Sustainability, Contact)

## 📋 Current Navigation:

1. **Home** ✅
2. **About** ✅
3. **Tours** ✅
4. **Culture** ✅ (can add content manually)
5. **Guides** ✅
6. **Sustainability** ✅
7. **Contact** ✅

## 📝 Pages Still Exist (But Hidden from Nav):

The following pages still exist but are **not in navigation**:
- `/gallery` - Shows "Gallery Coming Soon"
- `/stories` - Shows "Stories Coming Soon"
- `/music` - Shows "Music Collection Coming Soon"

**Why?** In case you want to add content later, the pages are ready. If you want to delete them completely, let me know!

## 🎯 To Add Content Later:

If you want to add content to these pages later:

1. **Gallery**: Go to Sanity Studio → Media → Gallery → Add items
2. **Stories**: Go to Sanity Studio → Content → Stories / Blog → Add stories
3. **Music**: Go to Sanity Studio → Media → Music → Add entries

Then add them back to navigation in `src/components/Navbar.jsx`

## 🗑️ To Delete Pages Completely:

If you want to delete these pages entirely, I can:
- Delete the page files
- Remove routes
- Clean up components

Just let me know!

**Current Status**: Navigation is clean, showing only pages with content! ✅
