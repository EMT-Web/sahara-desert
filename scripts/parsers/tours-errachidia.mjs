Along the way you will pass traditional Berber villages, dramatic landscapes, and panoramic viewpoints — perfect for photos and soaking up the essence of southeastern Morocco.
Continue to Erfoud, a historic desert town known for its fossil workshops and Saharan heritage, before reaching Merzouga, the gateway to the Erg Chebbi dunes — the most famous sand dunes in Morocco. Upon arrival, prepare for your camel trek into the Sahara, riding across golden sand toward your desert camp as the sun sets in vibrant colors over the horizon. Feel the silence of the desert and enjoy a traditional Berber dinner around the fire, surrounded by endless dunes and a sky full of stars — a highlight of any Morocco desert adventure.
