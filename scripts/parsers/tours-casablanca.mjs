Your private Morocco tour begins with a pickup from your accommodation in Casablanca. The first highlight is a visit to the Hassan II Mosque, the largest mosque in Morocco and the only one open to non-Muslim visitors, beautifully set along the Atlantic coast.
After the visit, we drive north along the coastline to Rabat, Morocco's capital and one of its four imperial cities. In Rabat, you will explore the Kasbah of the Oudayas, a historic fortress overlooking the Atlantic Ocean, followed by a visit to the Hassan Tower, one of the city's most iconic landmarks.

We then continue inland to Meknes, a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of Morocco's most fortified imperial cities. Here, you will visit the city's main highlights, including Bab Mansour, one of the most impressive gates in North Africa, the Qara Prison, Lahdim Square, and the vast Heri es-Souani granaries and stables.

Next, drive to Tinghir and the spectacular Todgha Gorges, towering limestone canyons carved by a river flowing from the High Atlas Mountains.
The route then follows the famous Road of a Thousand Kasbahs to the Dades Valley, known for its dramatic rock formations, green fields, and fig and walnut trees.
